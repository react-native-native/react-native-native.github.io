# Introduction (/docs)



<Callout type="warn">
  **Experimental.** React Native Native is in active development. Core functionality works, but certain language-specific features may be incomplete or unstable. Currently only tested on macOS. See [Known Issues](#known-issues) below before using in production.
</Callout>

React Native Native lets you write native components and modules in **any compiled language** — Rust, C++, Kotlin/Compose, Swift/ObjC — and hot-reload them on a physical device, just like JavaScript.

Why? [#why]

React Native's native module system requires you to write Swift/Kotlin wrappers, maintain Xcode/Android Studio projects, and rebuild the entire app for every change. React Native Native removes all of that:

* **Write native code in your editor** — no IDE switching
* **Save and see** — Metro compiles, signs, and hot-reloads native code on device
* **Full platform SDK access** — use any iOS framework or Android API directly
* **Works with Expo** — drops into any Expo project as a module

How it works [#how-it-works]

Your native code becomes a React component or module that JS can use like any other:

```tsx
import { fibonacci } from './rust_math';    // Rust function
import GradientBox from './GradientBox';    // ObjC++ component

<Text>{fibonacci(10)}</Text>
<GradientBox title="Hello!" style={{ width: 300, height: 200 }} />
```

Development [#development]

Metro watches your native files alongside JavaScript. When you save a `.cpp`, `.rs`, `.swift`, or `.kt` file:

1. **Metro compiles** it to a signed dynamic library (`.dylib` on iOS, `.dex` on Android)
2. **Device pulls** the compiled library over HTTP — same as a JS bundle refresh
3. **Runtime loads** it via `dlopen` (iOS) or `DexClassLoader` (Android)
4. **Hot-reload** — your changes appear on device in seconds, no full rebuild

```
Save .cpp → Metro compiles → device loads .dylib → hot-reload
```

This works on both simulators and physical devices. Metro auto-detects the target architecture and compiles accordingly.

Production [#production]

In release builds, all native code is statically linked into the app binary. No dynamic libraries, no runtime code loading.

**iOS** — A CocoaPods script phase runs before compilation:

1. Scans your project for native files (`.cpp`, `.mm`, `.swift`, `.rs`)
2. Generates combined bridge files — one `.mm` for all C++/ObjC++ bridges, one `.swift` for all Swift bridges
3. Compiles Rust into a single static library (`libnativ_user.a`)
4. Xcode compiles and links everything into the app binary

**Android** — A Gradle pre-build task does the same:

1. Generates per-module bridge files and Kotlin wrappers
2. Compiles Rust for all ABIs (arm64, armv7, x86\_64, x86)
3. Gradle compiles and packages everything into the APK

Metro only bundles JavaScript in production — all native code is handled by the platform build system.

```bash
# Build for release — native compilation is automatic
npx expo run:ios --configuration Release
npx expo run:android --variant release
```

See [Production Builds](/docs/getting-started/production) for details on EAS Build and CI setup.

Known issues [#known-issues]

* **Zig support** — planned but not yet available.

Language setup [#language-setup]

C++, Objective-C++, and Swift work out of the box with no additional setup. Some languages have additional setup steps for your development environment — see the individual language guides for details:

* [Rust](/docs/guides/rust#setup) — install Rust targets and create `Cargo.toml`
* [Kotlin](/docs/guides/kotlin#setup) — download the Kotlin compiler toolchain
* [Kotlin with Compose](/docs/guides/kotlin#compose-setup) — additional Compose compiler toolchain
