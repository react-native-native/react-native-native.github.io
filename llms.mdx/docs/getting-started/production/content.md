# Production Builds (/docs/getting-started/production)



During development, native code hot-reloads via `dlopen` (iOS) and `DexClassLoader` (Android). In production, everything is statically linked — no runtime code loading.

How it works [#how-it-works]

When you build for release, React Native Native:

1. **Scans** your project for native files (`.rs`, `.cpp`, `.mm`, `.swift`, `.kt`)
2. **Generates bridges** — the glue code that registers your functions and components with the runtime
3. **Compiles** Rust into a static library
4. **Links statically** — Xcode/Gradle compile the bridges and link everything into the app binary

```bash
# iOS release build
npx expo run:ios --configuration Release

# Android release build
npx expo run:android --variant release
```

No extra steps — the native compilers are invoked automatically by CocoaPods (iOS) and Gradle (Android) as part of the normal build.

Development vs production [#development-vs-production]

|                         | Development                       | Production                       |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Native code loading** | `dlopen` / `DexClassLoader`       | Statically linked                |
| **Hot-reload**          | Yes                               | No                               |
| **Code signing**        | Ad-hoc per `.dylib`               | App-level signing                |
| **Metro serves native** | Yes (`.dylib` / `.dex` over HTTP) | No (JS bundle only)              |
| **Build system**        | Metro compiles on save            | CocoaPods / Gradle at build time |

iOS build pipeline [#ios-build-pipeline]

The Expo config plugin sets up a CocoaPods pod (`ReactNativeNativeUserCode`) with a `:before_compile` script phase. On Release builds, this script:

1. Generates `nativ_bridges.mm` — combined C++/ObjC++ bridges with constructor-based registration
2. Generates `nativ_bridges.swift` — combined Swift source with `@_cdecl` wrappers
3. Compiles Rust into `libnativ_user.a` — a single unified static library
4. Xcode compiles these files and links the `.a` as part of the normal build

On Debug builds, the script phase exits immediately — all native code loads via Metro dylibs instead.

<Callout type="info">
  Adding new native files does **not** require re-running `npx expo prebuild`. The bridge file names are fixed — only their content changes at build time.
</Callout>

Android build pipeline [#android-build-pipeline]

A Gradle pre-build task invokes the static compiler, which:

1. Generates per-module C++ bridge files with registration constructors
2. Generates Kotlin wrapper classes for `@nativ_export` functions
3. Compiles Rust for all ABIs (`arm64-v8a`, `armeabi-v7a`, `x86_64`, `x86`)
4. Generates a registry class that auto-registers all modules at init time

EAS Build [#eas-build]

React Native Native works with [EAS Build](https://docs.expo.dev/build/introduction/). C++, ObjC++, Swift, and Kotlin are compiled by Xcode/Gradle on EAS as usual — no extra steps.

**Rust requires extra setup** because `cargo` is not available on EAS build servers by default. There are two options:

Option 1: Install Rust on EAS (recommended) [#option-1-install-rust-on-eas-recommended]

Add a pre-install script to your `package.json` that installs Rust on the build server:

```json title="package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    "eas-build-pre-install": "./scripts/install-rust.sh"
  }
}
```

```bash title="scripts/install-rust.sh"
#!/bin/bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh -s -- -y
. $HOME/.cargo/env

if [ "$EAS_BUILD_PLATFORM" = "ios" ]; then
  rustup target add aarch64-apple-ios
elif [ "$EAS_BUILD_PLATFORM" = "android" ]; then
  rustup target add aarch64-linux-android armv7-linux-androideabi x86_64-linux-android
fi
```

```bash
chmod +x scripts/install-rust.sh
```

Then build normally:

```bash
eas build --platform ios
eas build --platform android
```

This adds \~30 seconds to the build for Rust installation. The CocoaPods script phase and Gradle task will compile your Rust code as part of the normal build.

Option 2: Prebuild locally [#option-2-prebuild-locally]

Compile Rust to static libraries on your machine, then build on EAS without Rust installed:

```bash
# Prebuild Rust for iOS
npx nativ build rust --platform ios

# Prebuild Rust for Android
npx nativ build rust --platform android
```

This compiles your Rust code into static libraries in `.nativ/bridges/` (iOS) or `.nativ/generated/release/` (Android). Make sure these are not in your `.gitignore` so EAS picks them up.

Then build normally:

```bash
eas build --platform ios
eas build --platform android
```

<Callout type="info">
  If you don't use Rust, neither option is needed — everything else compiles on EAS out of the box.
</Callout>
