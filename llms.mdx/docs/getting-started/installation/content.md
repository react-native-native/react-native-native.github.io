# Installation (/docs/getting-started/installation)



Prerequisites [#prerequisites]

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 18+
* [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/) (`npx expo`)
* **iOS**: Xcode 16+ with Command Line Tools
* **Android**: Android Studio with NDK installed (optional, Rust and C++ only)
* **Rust** (optional): `curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh`

Quick start [#quick-start]

The fastest way to get started — a pre-configured Expo template with a C++ example:

```bash
npx create-expo-app my-app --template @react-native-native/template-starter
cd my-app
```

This includes `metro.config.js`, `tsconfig.json`, `.gitignore`, and a `hello.cpp` example ready to go. Skip to [Build and run](#build-and-run).

Add to an existing project [#add-to-an-existing-project]

```bash
npx expo install @react-native-native/nativ-fabric
```

Configure native builds [#configure-native-builds]

Add the config plugin to your `app.json`:

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "plugins": [
      "@react-native-native/nativ-fabric"
    ]
  }
}
```

Build and run [#build-and-run]

Create a Development Build locally or via EAS:

```bash
# Local build — iOS
npx expo run:ios

# Local build — Android
npx expo run:android

# Or via EAS Build
eas build --profile development
```

Once the build is installed, start Metro:

```bash
npx expo start
```

That's it. You're ready to write native code.

Setup wizard [#setup-wizard]

Run the interactive setup to configure toolchains for the languages you want to use:

```bash
npx nativ setup
```

This asks which platforms and languages you need, then installs the required toolchains. You can also run individual setup commands directly:

```bash
npx nativ setup rust      # Rust targets + Cargo.toml
npx nativ setup kotlin    # Kotlin compiler toolchain
npx nativ setup compose   # Jetpack Compose (includes Kotlin)
```

C++ and Swift require no additional setup — Xcode and the Android NDK provide everything needed.

Use `--platform` to limit setup to a single platform:

```bash
npx nativ setup rust --platform ios
```

After setup, run `doctor` to verify everything is configured correctly:

```bash
npx nativ doctor
```

See [Troubleshooting](/docs/troubleshooting) for common issues.

Expo compatibility [#expo-compatibility]

React Native Native requires a **Development Build** — a custom-compiled version of your app that includes the native runtime. This works on both **physical devices and simulators**.

<Callout type="warn">
  **Expo Go is not supported.** Expo Go is a pre-built app that can't load custom native code.
</Callout>

| Environment                            | Supported |
| -------------------------------------- | --------- |
| Development Build (physical device)    | Yes       |
| Development Build (simulator/emulator) | Yes       |
| EAS Build                              | Yes       |
| Expo Go                                | No        |

If you're used to Expo Go, the switch to Development Builds is a one-time setup — after that the workflow is identical, with the added ability to run native code.
